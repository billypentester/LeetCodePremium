Given the array houses where houses[i] is the location of the ith house along a street and an integer k, allocate k mailboxes in the street.

Return the minimum total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.


class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(vector<int>& houses, int k) {
        
    }
};
