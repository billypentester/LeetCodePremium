Given an array of strings words (without duplicates), return all the concatenated words in the given list of words.

A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

Input: words = ["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]
Output: ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]
Explanation: "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
"dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(vector<string>& words) {
        unordered_set<string> dictionary(words.begin(), words.end());
        vector<string> answer;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            const int length = word.length();
            vector<bool> dp(length + 1);
            dp[0] = true;
            for (int i = 1; i <= length; ++i) {
                for (int j = (i == length ? 1 : 0); !dp[i] && j < i; ++j) {
                    dp[i] = dp[j] && dictionary.count(word.substr(j, i - j));
                }
            }
            if (dp[length]) {
                answer.push_back(word);
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
